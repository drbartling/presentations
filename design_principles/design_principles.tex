    {Symptoms of Rotting Code}

    Four Symptoms of Rotting Code\pause

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Rigidity\pause
        \item Fragility\pause
        \item Immobility\pause
        \item Viscosity\pause
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}{Rigidity}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \href{https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rigid}
            {Deficient in or devoid of flexibility}
        \item<2-> Software for which extra effort is expended in order to make
            changes.
    \end{itemize}

            brick.jpg}};}%
\begin{frame}{Rigidity}

    How it happens
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> Code written in a procedural way
        \item<2-> Lack of abstractions
        \item<3-> Solving a generic problem with implementation specific details
        \item<4-> Spreading a single responsibility throught several parts
        \item<5-> When componenets need a lot of knowledge about each other in
            order to function
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
}

        \includegraphics[height=\paperheight,width=\paperwidth]{%
            brick.jpg}};}%
\begin{frame}{Rigidity}

    How to avoid it
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> Break the code into smaller concepts
        \item<2-> Solve the details and provide a problem oriented abstraction
        \item<3-> Solving a generic problem with implementation specific details
        \item<4-> Write DRY code (Don't repeat yourself)
        \item<5-> Define the code in logical pices.  Set boundaries and
            responsibilities.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}

        \item<3->Viscous Environment
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<5->Long builds
