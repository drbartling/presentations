        \item Immobility\pause

\begin{frame}{Rigidity}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \href{https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rigid}
            {Deficient in or devoid of flexibility}
        \item<2-> Software for which extra effort is expended in order to make
            changes.
    \end{itemize}

        \includegraphics<handout:0>[height=\paperheight,width=\paperwidth]{%
            brick.jpg}};}%
\begin{frame}{Rigidity}

    How it happens
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> Code written in a procedural way
        \item<2-> Lack of abstractions
        \item<3-> Solving a generic problem with implementation specific details
        \item<4-> Spreading a single responsibility throughout several parts
        \item<5-> When components need a lot of knowledge about each other in
            order to function
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

        \includegraphics<handout:0>[height=\paperheight,width=\paperwidth]{%
            brick.jpg}};}%
\begin{frame}{Rigidity}

    How to avoid it
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> Break the code into smaller concepts
        \item<2-> Solve the details and provide a problem oriented abstraction
        \item<3-> Solving a generic problem with implementation specific details
        \item<4-> Write DRY code (Don't repeat yourself)
        \item<5-> Define the code in logical pieces.  Set boundaries and
            responsibilities.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Fragility}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \href{https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fragile}
            {Easily broken or destroyed}
        \item<2-> Software for which extra risk is incurred in order to make
            changes.

\begin{frame}{Fragility}

    How it happens
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> Implicit dependencies
        \item<2-> Relying on implementation details
        \item<3-> Relying upon side effects of operations
        \item<4-> Reaching past abstraction layers
        \item<5-> Unmanaged complexity

\begin{frame}{Fragility}

    How to avoid it
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> Implicit dependencies
        \item<2-> Law of Demeter: principle of least knowledge
        \item<3-> Avoid side effects, and don't rely on the side effects of
            other modules
        \item<4-> Rely on the published API
        \item<5-> Invent and \textbf{simplify}

\begin{frame}{Immobility}
    How it happens
