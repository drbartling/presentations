# <Type>: <presentation>: <section> #50-char lim #
# 72-character lines for description ###################################

# e.g.:
# chore: Add commit message template

# Captiolize subject line.
# Write capitolized imperitive statement with no period for subject
# List details of significant changes below the subject line
# Write details as capitolized imperitive statements
# Provide the below sections for further context

# Why:

# A short imperitve subject helps when viewing the log, especially when
# viewing one-line formatted logs.  Clear writing of what changed helps
# give a clean understanding of context when reading blame messages and
# when looking at a specific commit.

# Related Issues:
# Link to related issue numbers (hyper link if applicable), e.g.:
# git issue 123

# References:
# List relevant references e.g.:
# https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

# Type can be
#    feat     (new feature)

#    docs     (changes to documentation)
